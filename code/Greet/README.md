# `Greet` service

The `Greet` service is the main public entry point. In total, it serves to greet a user who is identified through their numerical ID.

It also integrates with another out-of-context AWS service (`User`) and with an external service (`GreetingPhrase`) hosted on Mockachino (`https://www.mockachino.com`).
